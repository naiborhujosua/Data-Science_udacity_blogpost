## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in the Airbnb open data about New York City listings:

Question 1: Which User spent most during black Friday, list the top 20 spending users


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

AB_NYC_2019.csv      - This observations is about the  New York City Airnbnb listings Open Data, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values as well that will be cleaned through the jupyter notebook.
