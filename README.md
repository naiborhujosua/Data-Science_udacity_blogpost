## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are some installation of Anaconda that could be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/).  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in the Airbnb open data about New York City listings:

> * Question 1: What are the most reviewed istings?list the 10 listings
> * Question 2: What are the NY neigbourhood group with listings? list them
> * Question 3: What are the Top 10 neighbourhood with Airbnb listings? Visualize it
> * Question 4: What is the influence neighbourhood group on roop type?  visualize it
> * Question 5: How many flats are more than expensive than 500$/night?Could we remove those outliers from visualization? What techniques can we use?
> * Question 6: plots the map of the distribution of flat prices based on neighborhood group?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the questions above. The notebooks is the process of answering all the questions above. There is a markdwon to show the thought process in solving the problems.

AB_NYC_2019.csv dataset contains 48895 rows and 16 columns about the  New York City Airnbnb listings Open Data, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values as well that will be cleaned through the jupyter notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
